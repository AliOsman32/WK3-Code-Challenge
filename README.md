 # Description
# * **<Flatdango>**
Flatdango is a web application that gives movie information. It allows users to see the details of the movie and know when it will be streaming. The Flatdingo application uses a db.json file which runs on a json server. The application uses fetch javascript api to communicate to the json server. The frontend is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
One can view movie details for every movie.
One can buy a ticket. Once the tickets sold and the capacity are the same, it means the tickets are sold out. This means you cant buy any more ticket.


To use the application you have to open the code in visual studio. Start the terminal and type the following command
npm i
After the operation start the json server by typing the following command in terminal
 json-server --watch db.json

 Ensure live server extension is installed in visual studio code. Click at the Go Live link on the bottom right of visual studio.
